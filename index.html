    <h3 class="review-title">Highly Recommended!!!</h3>
    <p>After looking for so long for a perfect hair salon on Long Island, I finally can say I found it at Brenda’s Dream Salon. I got the best haircut! Brenda took her time and suggested the best haircut that fits my life style. She also gave me advice on how to maintain my healthy hair.</p>

    <p>Brenda does such a great job at being thoughtful and precise. She takes her time and doesn't whip through the appointment. She spends time with her clients and totally saved my hair! No rush, great style, trust her with your hair!</p>

    <h3 class="review-title">Brenda is great!!!</h3>
    <p>I have been having my haircut by her for 14 years now and she always does an amazing job!  She is professional, prompt, very sociable, and has a very clean salon.  My wife uses Brenda for her haircuts and coloring as well.  I would highly recommend Brenda to both men and woman for any of your hair styling needs!</p>

    <h3 class="review-title">I'm definitely going back to them.</h3>
    <p>I went to Brenda's yesterday for what looked like an almost impossible job: my hair was in very bad condition, besides having 3 different colors! Brenda took the time to explain my options and did an amazing job along side with her lovely daughter Nina. They are both very knowledgeable,  professional and pleasant.  I couldn't be happier with the results, my hair looks amazing. I'm definitely going back to them.</p>

    <h3 class="review-title">I truly recommend her as your stylist!</h3>
    <p>I’ve been coming to Brenda since I was a teenager and she never fails to impress me. She always looks out for what’s best for the client and what we want. She’s kind and not to mention her skills are amazing. Every time I get my hair done I leave ready to take on the world! I truly recommend her as your stylist!</p>

    <h3 class="review-title">Brenda is incredibly professional and her salon aesthetic is beautiful and relaxing.</h3>
    <p>I've been getting my hair cut with Brenda for at least 4 years now and she has been an absolute blessing for my curly hair. Before I met Brenda, I had never found a hair stylist who knew how to cut layers into curly hair. Brenda does an amazing job of cutting layers in my hair and releasing the curls so they look formed without looking frizzy and without making my hair look like a triangle! Brenda is incredibly professional and her salon aesthetic is beautiful and relaxing. Thank you, Brenda!!!</p>
